In JavaScript, a debounce function is used to limit the number of times a function gets called in a given time frame. This is useful when dealing with events that can trigger a lot of rapid-fire calls, such as scrolling, resizing, or typing.

The debounce function works by delaying the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has passed since the last time it was called. This ensures that the function only runs once during that time frame, regardless of how many times it was called.

Here's an example of a simple debounce function in JavaScript: https://sudirkrishnaars.github.io/Debounce-Function---Search-Functionality/
